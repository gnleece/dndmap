DM feature request:
"Probably load an image, jpg and png at least, but PDF would be nice too
Then allow me to define/scale a grid of squares on top of that image
And I can then “paint” to fill in those grids with black
And there should be some way to group the squares together, maybe the lightest weight version is just per stroke
All this should work with touch only on Windows
Which is to say you could use a mouse too but it should be doable using only touch
And then there’d need to be a way to hide groups one at a time, like with a double tap, or a tap and hold, or a fly out menu
It’d be cool if there could be a selection mechanic
That could be used to select individual squares and group them, and then also select groups and un-group or reveal them
Oh and all this should be on a sort of zoomable, scrollable canvas"
